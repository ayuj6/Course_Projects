# Course_Projects
Below is a brief description of all the projects in this repository.

### Eliza
For this project, we re-created the Eliza Chatbot that was developed at MIT. This program used pattern matching and substitution to simulate conversation between the bot and the user.
We use scripts that are similar to the original Chatbot to process the user inputs and return appropriate replies.

### Sokoban
In this project, we coded the Sokoban video game to be played on the program console. This program also adheres to the rules of the video game and makes use of different symbols to identify the walls, crates, worker, and storage locations.

### Book Library
This program essentially implements a library system to manage librarians and subscribers. For each type of user (librarian and subscriber) there are a variety of tasks that can be done:
**Librarian:** manages the books in the library and helps the  subscribers to check out or return books.
**Subscriber:** can borrow and return books, as well as update their information.

### Exceptional Book Library
This is an improved version of the "Book Library" program (mentioned above). These improvements are essentially to prevent erroneous inputs and prevent crashes.
It also has an added function from the original program that loads books to the books Arraylist of a library from a file and saves its content to a file. 

### Dessert Queue
This program required implementing a queue with circular indexing to solve a dinner problem. In this problem, the host chooses to serve guests based on the Josephus problem. Guests will be served based on the number of guests and the number of courses to be served.
This project helped to gain experience with using circular indexing with queues and analyzing varying time-complexities.

### Dictionary Using BST
This program involved the implementation of a dictionary using Binary Search Trees. The dictionary stores a collection of Dictionary words or definitions and the user multiple definitions to the dictionary.
The goal of this assignment was to becmome familiar with Binary Search Trees and understand how their insertion and remove operations work in efficient ways.

### Escape Room
For this project, we created an escape room game.
It includes clickable and draggable graphical elements (items in the game) that the player makes use of to work through the game and eventually win.

### Help Desk
For this project, we implemented a priority queue using the heap data structure to prioritize "support tickets." There tickets will be sorted by the help desk.

### Iterating to Philosophy
For this project, we made use of the Iterator and Iterable interfaces available to us. 
This program will collect data on-demand - and depending on the intial data entered, it will attempt to direct itself to the "Philosophy" Wikipedia page.
This pattern is used to review Wikipedia and the value of its Philosophy page.

### Particle Fountain
For this project, we developed a graphical implementation of a particle system. This project is to uses multiple small images give the illusion of a water fountain.
This project allowed me to gain experience to working with real-time graphics. 

### Shopping Cart
For this project, we implemented a simple Shopping Cart that made use of arrays.
This program allows us to do many operations such as:
***[P] Print the market catalog
[A] Add one occurrence of an item to the cart given its identifier
[C] Checkout
[D] Display the cart contents
[O] Number of occurrences of an item in the cart given its identifier
[R] Remove one occurrence of an item from the cart given its identifier
[Q] Quit the application***
This program, like many others, was run on the console.

### Storage Unit
For this project we implemented a storage unit to be sorted in a singly linked list.
This program stores boxes of different colors and weights (and is ordered primarily by weight).
This project also implements a graphic application of the storage unit.

### TestADT
This project makes use of the BST ADT along with their insert, remove, contains, get, and size methods.
The purpose of this project is to create our own Binary Search Tree ADT and understand its functionality.

### Package Manager
This project is used to process json package dependency files (that are given in the json files to be read).
Each package that depends upon other packages has its own entry in the json file.  
This program will read package information and provide information about the packages that must be installed before any given package can be installed.
This program makes use of the Graph ADT and Cycle Detection to ensure that it functions as expected.

### Book HashTable
This project had us create a HashTable to store "Book" (node) entries. We implement our own hashing algorithm (described in program header) that will be used by the Hashtable.
The purpose of this project is to help us understand the HashTable ADT and how their insert, remove, and resize operations work.

### B-Plus Tree
This project had us create and implement our own B+ Tree to allow efficient acces to many different indexes of a large data set. 
The goal of this program is to understand the operations of the ADT and their traversals. As well as understanding the time-complexities better.

### AVL Tree
For this project, we created and implemented a Balance Search Tree (which was an AVL tree in this instance). We had to make use of all the balancing cases - as well as the insert, remove, get, and traversal operations.
The main goal of this project was to better understand the Balance Search Tree ADT and analyze their time-complexities.
